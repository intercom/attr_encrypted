This is the Intercom's fork of the https://github.com/attr-encrypted/attr_encrypted gem which is in sunset mode and is not maintained any more. We are forking the gem to provide temporary Rails 7 support until the gem is fully replaced with ActiveRecord encryption, at which stage the gem and the repo should be removed.
